This capstone project, SkillWallet, was developed as part of the Salesforce Developer Program under the platform “WhatNext Vision Motors.” The core objective was to build a fully functional Salesforce CRM-based vehicle ordering system that automates customer-dealer interactions, validates stock levels in real time, and assigns dealers based on customer proximity. Using custom objects, flows, Apex triggers, and scheduled jobs, the solution transforms a traditionally manual process into a smart, automated, and scalable digital experience. The project also showcases end-to-end Salesforce development — from data modeling to Lightning App creation — while aligning with real-world business use cases in the automotive domain.
